            <h1>About Daily Toolkit</h1>

            <h2>What is Daily Toolkit?</h2>
            <p>Daily Toolkit is a free collection of fun and practical web-based tools designed to make your everyday decisions a little easier and a lot more enjoyable. Whether you need a lucky set of lotto numbers, a quick lunch suggestion, or want to test an AI model that tells dogs from cats, we have something for you.</p>

            <h2>Our Tools</h2>

            <h3>Lotto Number Generator</h3>
            <p>Our lotto number generator uses a random algorithm to produce two unique groups of numbers. Each group consists of 5 regular numbers drawn from 1 to 49 and 1 mega ball drawn from 1 to 25. The numbers are color-coded by range so you can quickly scan your picks. It's a fun way to choose your next set of lottery numbers without any bias.</p>

            <h3>Lunch Menu Recommender</h3>
            <p>Decision fatigue is real, especially when it comes to lunch. Our lunch recommender randomly selects from a handpicked list of 15 popular dishes spanning Korean, Japanese, Italian, and American cuisines. From Kimchi Jjigae and Bibimbap to Pasta Carbonara and Beef Burgers, each recommendation comes with a description so you know exactly what you're getting into. Just click the button and let fate decide your next meal.</p>

            <h3>Dog or Cat AI Classifier</h3>
            <p>Powered by Google's Teachable Machine and TensorFlow.js, this tool uses your webcam to classify images as either a dog or a cat. The model was custom-trained to recognize the two animals. When you start the camera, a 3-second countdown gives you time to position your pet (or a photo of one) in front of the webcam. After the countdown, the AI analyzes the image and displays its prediction along with a confidence percentage. All processing happens locally in your browser — no images are uploaded anywhere.</p>

            <h3>Review &amp; Feedback Form</h3>
            <p>We value your feedback. The review section lets you rate your experience with our tools on a 5-star scale and leave a written message. Your input helps us understand what's working well and what we can improve. All submissions are handled securely through Formspree.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We believe that simple tools can bring a lot of joy. Daily Toolkit was built with the goal of creating small, useful utilities that anyone can use for free, with no sign-ups or downloads required. We're constantly exploring new ideas and welcome your suggestions for tools you'd like to see added.</p>

            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>Daily Toolkit is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no heavy frameworks, no unnecessary complexity. The AI classifier leverages TensorFlow.js for in-browser machine learning. We prioritize fast loading times, accessibility, and a clean user experience.</p>
